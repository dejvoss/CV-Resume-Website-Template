                        <p>I was born in Poland, which was just coming out of the Soviet occupation. It was a time of
                            great socio-economic change, but this article is not about that, it's about my adventure
                            with computers, so let's jump to it.</p>
                        <p>My technology adventure started in a primary school on the IT lessons, but I learned the real
                            magic with colleagues after school and when i got first computer.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am not the dinosaur it wasn't a time of Atari, but Pentium III and Celeron. A blessing in
                            disguise I was the one who with Celeron 466Mhz, which quickly prompted me to search for
                            performance improvements. Those searching and my inborn curiosity brought me to open the
                            computer case.
                        </p>
                        <p> Experiments with upgrading hardware and discovering new software led me many times to
                            a point that I wasn't able to solve the issue on my own. Lucky me I had an older friend
                            who was studying computer science and was always there to help. I could say that he was my
                            first real IT teacher. My ability to learn quickly led me to become a local computer expert
                            and I started helping friends with their PC's.
                        </p>
                        <p>My room began to fill up with floppy disks, cd-ROMs, spare parts, and diagnostic tools. I
                            decided to go to the electronic technical high school, but a bit before that, internet came
                            to my home.</p>
                        <p>My friend showed me the Mirc and Linux and I discovered the trojans. We infected computers in
                            school and computers of our girl-friends, to control those desktops. It was only a carefree
                            fun which gave me another portion of knowledge.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the time of high school, I was enjoying the parties, but also gaining new knowledge from
                            school and from helping others. I learned fast typing by rewriting master thesis of my mam.
                            I gained knowledge of excel by helping my father and knowledge about windows os by helping
                            friends. At school i learned
                            basics of microprocessors and programming logic. My favorite subject was the basics of
                            electronics because I picked it up on the fly and didn't have to repeat anything to get good
                            grades. At home I started writing basics programs in Pascal and i learned basics of HTML.
                        </p>
                        <p>When I was entering adulthood the world was plunged into an economic crisis that pushed me to
                            learn economics and emigrate to the United Kingdom. I didn't have a big range of
                            job selections and I landed in the logistics industry. After 4 years of working in many
                            different places and travelling around the world I came back to Poland. I found a full-time
                            job in logistics and I started an e-commerce business. It wasn't successful, but I learned
                            WordPress and Prestashop.
                        </p>
                        <p>Then in 2015, I decided to move out again. That time I went to the Netherlands and I found a
                            job of course again in logistics. After a year of working in a warehouse my superiors
                            saw my problem-solving, quick learning, and creative thinking potentials, and I've been
                            promoted to office work. The admin position made me realize that all my knowledge gained in
                            past is super useful, raise my self confident, and opened me to extend those skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>I was watching the VBA Programming+Macros video course after work and I was implementing new
                            tips and tricks at work. My automated reports still work there and sometimes they call me to
                            ask about new stuff to implement.
                            We had there one woman who was not very familiar with excel and every time she had trouble
                            filling data in the sheet. That's my story with front-end began. I created the excel forms
                            to have a front-end application and the backend was in excel sheets. I realized quickly that
                            excel is limited and I started looking for better solutions.</p>
                        <p>I learned the basics of python and I finished the HTML5 course on edx.org. I've received
                            kaizen certification for my projects and my employer gave me an opportunity to make paid
                            school. I found out about Code Institute where I studied software development and in
                            meantime, I changed the job to Production Controller with advanced excel skills.

                            I am working there to this day and I am implementing automated reporting by using python,
                            Tableau, and Power BI.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After work, I am still helping friends with their computers, I am working on my websites and
                            I am looking for a full-time job in the tech industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>By my all lifetime I was close to technology and IT, but I never had a chance to work in a
                            professional team. I feel that now is the time for it and if you did read this all, I
                            believe that you see this also. </p>
